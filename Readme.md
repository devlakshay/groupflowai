## Right Now it works Locally

Yes , as we have yet to host it on a server it works locally and also you need a flowise web service locally hosted to use this (Currently).

## To Run This - Commands

For building Frontend :
1.) npm run dev (Local Development server for contributing / having a glimpse of how it works)

For Backend :
1.) Express backend works on node (node index.js)
2.) Flask Backend works with python env. (python -u app.py (filepath))
